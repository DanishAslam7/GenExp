# GenExp
This is the R code to extract Gene Expression Profiles of particular genes from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) datasets.

Prerequisites:
# DATA COLLECTION

  # GenBank is the NIH genetic sequence database, an annotated collection of all publicly available DNA sequences  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
  Do a Literature Review to find genes of interest. In my case, I had 9 genes of interest because of their role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
  
  # GEO is a public functional genomics data repository (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
  Choose expression datasets from GEO relevant to your study. The datasets must be related to your disease of interest, for example, the datasets that I used were associated with Alzheimer's disease.

  # My study was focused on just the 9 genes of interest so I wanted just their expression profiles from the dataset.
  You don't need to download the datasets. Just make sure to keep a note of the reference series number assocated with the accesion number of your sample since this will be used in extraction steps.
